## OASIS TC Open Repository: openc2-oif-obo

This GitHub public repository [openc2-oif-obo](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-oif-obo/) was created at the request of the [OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/) as an [OASIS TC Open Repository](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/) to support development of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.

While this TC Open Repository remains associated with the sponsor TC, its development priorities, leadership, intellectual property terms, participation rules, and other matters of governance are separate and distinct from the OASIS TC Process and related policies.

All contributions made to this TC Open Repository are subject to open source license terms expressed in [Apache-2.0 license](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-oif-orchestrator/blob/master/LICENSE.md). That license was selected as the declared [Applicable License](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses) when the TC voted to create this Open Repository.

As documented in [Public Participation Invited](href="https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-oif-obo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#public-participation-invited), contributions to this TC Open Repository are invited from all parties, whether affiliated with OASIS or not. Participants must have a GitHub account, but no fees or OASIS membership obligations are required.  Participation is expected to be consistent with the [OASIS TC Open Repository Guidelines and Procedures](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-repositories), the open source [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) designated for this particular repository, and the requirement for an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/cla/individual-cla) that governs intellectual property.

## Statement of Purpose

This repository supports implementation of an OpenC2 Integration Framework (OIF) family product that can be configured as an intermediate producer-consumer; this product will be called the OIF Bridge Orchestrator (OBO). 

Many OpenC2 use cases involve a Producer interacting with a Consumer that in turn manages subordinate devices. While such a Consumer can be achieved with an amalgamation of an OIF-Device and an OIF-Orchestrator, having a tool designed to utilize OIF for this purpose will allow this tool to receive individual focus and updates tailored for its specific role. Current OIF-Orchestrator implementations require user-facing features such as a GUI that are unnecessary in many intermediate implementations and require using tools from a variety of repositories to create one effective intermediate device. This open repository serves to focus that work.
